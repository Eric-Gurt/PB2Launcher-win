# PB2Launcher-win
 
Basic Windows 10 launcher for Plazma Burst 2 game. 

Capable of updating .swf file of a game and implements basic authentification. Feel free too use in other projects or even make releases for other operating systems (I will review source code in order to publish different versions to official website).
